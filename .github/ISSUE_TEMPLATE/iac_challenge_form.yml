        #### Context

        Inside the SSM parameter store there is a parameter called `ifood-card`. This parameter is `base64` encoded with a message inside.

        The first person to create a terraform code using native terraform components [data](https://www.terraform.io/language/data-sources) and [output](https://www.terraform.io/language/values/outputs) to get the value, do a base64 decode, and fill this issue will get the award.

        You should work writing the terraform block inside this repo is the [challenge](https://github.com/arthurbdiniz/iac-tutorial/tree/main/challenge) folder. Make sure to edit only the file `card.tf`.

        I will provide AWS credentials during the class for you to be able to connect to the cloud provider.

        Good luck and thanks for take your time participating on this challenge!! ðŸš€
